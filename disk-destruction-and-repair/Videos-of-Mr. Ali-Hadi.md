### Fixing Corrupted Drive Partitions and Headers
____
This README file gives a concise summary of six scenarios described by Professor Ali Hadi in a series of YouTube videos. The videos cover the repair of corrupted Master Boot Record (MBR) and GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitions and headers using the WinHex software tool.

1. Repair MBR Partitions
In the video [Fixing a Corrupted MBR Drive - Case #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2wcW3rcXro&t=1s), Professor Hadi demonstrates how to repair corrupted MBR partitions using a Windows-based disk management tool.

2. Repair MBR Header
The video [Fixing and Loading a Corrupted MBR Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKCp67GcN0M) covers the process of repairing a corrupted MBR header, which is essential for the system to properly boot from the drive.

3. Repair Protective MBR Header
In the video [Fixing a Corrupted GPT Drive - Case #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfQh60ZtAY0), Professor Hadi explains how to repair a corrupted Protective MBR header, which is required for GPT-formatted drives.

4. Repair GPT Header
The video [Fixing a Corrupted GPT Drive - Case #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epx_6985uuk) demonstrates the process of repairing a corrupted GPT header, which is the main partition table for GPT-formatted drives.

5. Repair GPT Partitions
In the video [Fixing a Corrupted GPT Drive - Case #3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DZFcsVNxYM&t=1s), Professor Hadi shows how to repair corrupted GPT partitions using a Windows-based disk management tool.

6. Repair GPT Partitions with Corrupted Protective MBR & GPT Header
The video [Fixing and Loading a Corrupted GPT Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcvnmsjDa2Q) covers the process of repairing GPT partitions when both the Protective MBR and the GPT header are corrupted.

Please refer to the individual YouTube videos for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to perform these repairs.
