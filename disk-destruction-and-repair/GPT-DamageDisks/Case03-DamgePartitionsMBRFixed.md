1. *Open 010 Editor:*
   - Launch the 010 Editor application.
   - Drag and drop the disk that needs repair into the program.

2. *Load Templates:*
   - Once the disk is loaded, go to the top menu and select Templates.
   - Navigate to Drives and select Drive.
   - You should now be able to read the template results. If the results do not appear after selecting Drive, go to the View menu and select Template Results.

3. *Identify the Problem:*
   - Check the first 512 bytes of the disk. If their value is ......, it means there is no information present.

4. *Fix the MBR:*
   - Create a new virtual disk with a healthy MBR (Master Boot Record).
   - Open this virtual disk in 010 Editor.
   - Copy the first 512 bytes from the healthy virtual disk.

5. *Paste and Save:*
   - Return to the corrupted disk in 010 Editor.
   - Paste the copied 512 bytes into the first 512 bytes of the corrupted disk.
   - Save the file with a new name.

6. *Verify the Repair:*
   - Open the saved file in FTK Imager to verify the repair.

By following these steps, you should be able to repair the corrupted disk's MBR using 010 Editor.
