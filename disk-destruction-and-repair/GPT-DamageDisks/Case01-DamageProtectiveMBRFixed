#Repair the MBR Block
Use the disk imaging tool to repair the MBR block. This typically involves overwriting the MBR with a known good or default MBR. The exact steps may vary depending on the tool used, but generally, you'll need to:

Open the disk image file.
Locate the MBR block (usually the first 512 bytes of the disk image).
Overwrite the MBR block with a known good or default MBR.
Save the disk image file.
